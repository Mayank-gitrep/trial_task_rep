Trial Task Project

The task was about creating a webpage which takes input as a url from stackoverflow (eg. https://stackoverflow.com/users/696257/dkulkarni) and gives a relative ranking of how that userâ€™s profile ranks based initially on just on their stackoverflow reputation (include number of gold/silver/bronze badges, number of answers, number of questions, people reached). 


Getting Started

(use a ubuntu or mac OS to run and coding is done in python 3.6)
1. To run the Program just Download the files into a specific directory.
2. Next, open the terminal and go into that directory.
3. now use the command:
		`source env/bin/activate`
to create the virtual environment.
4. use: 
		`python3 repy.py`
   to run the program.
5. If the program runs, go into the browser and type: 
		`localhost:5000`
  and type a stackoverflow user's url in the text box (eg. https://stackoverflow.com/users/696257/dkulkarni) 
6. The result should contain the Username, Reputation, Ranking, Gold, Silver, Bronze batch counts, number of Answers, Questions and People Reached.

No need to install any packages explicitly. Everything is there in the repo.
